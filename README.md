# Edge Microvisor Toolkit

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](./LICENSE)

Edge Microvisor Toolkit is a reference Linux operating system that demonstrates the full
capabilities of Intel® platforms for Edge AI workloads. Built on Azure Linux, it features an
[Intel®-maintained Linux Kernel](./docs/developer-guide/emt-architecture-overview.md#next-kernel),
incorporating all the latest patches that have not yet been
upstreamed. These patches optimize performance and enhance other capabilities for Intel®
silicon, streamlining integration for operating system vendors and technology partners.

Edge Microvisor Toolkit is [published in several versions](./docs/developer-guide/get-started/emt-versions.md),
both immutable and mutable.
It may be used to quickly deploy, validate, and benchmark edge AI workloads, including those
requiring real-time processing. You can also use the toolkit's flexible build infrastructure
to create custom images from a large set of pre-provisioned packages.

Edge Microvisor Toolkit has undergone extensive validation across the Intel® Xeon®,
Intel® Core Ultra™, Intel Core™, and Intel® Atom® processor families. It provides robust
support for integrated NPU as well as a
[selection of discrete GPU cards](./docs/developer-guide/emt-system-requirements.md#hardware-requirements).

You can either build Edge Microvisor Toolkit by following step-by-step instructions or
download it directly. Both the build system and Edge Microvisor Toolkit are available as open
source.

## Get Started

To find out how to deploy and work with Edge Microvisor Toolkit, see the
[Get Started guide](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2025.2/edge-microvisor-toolkit/emt-get-started.html).
